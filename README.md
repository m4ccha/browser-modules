Implementation of [http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1](CommonJS
Modules/1.1) standard-compliant module loader that runs in modern web browsers.

== Goal ==

Project aims at enabling writing portable JavaScript code
that runs on server-side javascript platforms as well as in the browser.
CommonJS way of loading modules was chosen because it's secure, more
user-friendly than asynchronous loading schemes and already implemented
on many platforms (primarily [http://nodejs.org/](nodejs)).
